								<p>Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! I'm Chris Curtis, a passionate data enthusiast with a strong foundation in public health and a passion for leveraging data to drive positive change. With my education in public health and my experiences in the healthcare industry, I bring a unique perspective to data analytics, combining a keen attention to detail with my passion for improving health outcomes and systems in our communities.
								<br><br>
								While earning my bachelor's degree in Public Health, I learned about disease prevention, intervention implementation, and analyzing health and survey data to develop health improvement programs. During my senior year, I worked with the Utah County Health Department on creating a program addressing mental health concerns for a Provo neighborhood; I also interned with the Utah Office of Healthcare Statistics, where I analyzed data in Excel to help address a legislative request during the 2022 Utah Legislative session and created visualizations that were presented in the April 2022 Utah Disabilities Advisory Committee meeting. I also had the opportunity to enroll in data analytics courses specifically for public health data. I learned valuable skills such as coding in SAS, analyzing Excel data, and managing nonprofits' budgets.
								<br><br>
								In my professional career, I have had the opportunity to work for both healthcare data companies and a nonprofit consulting company. At Cotiviti and Collective Health, I utilized tools such as Excel and SQL to analyze medical records and member data, clean and filter incorrect data, and use data to provide answers and drive productivity. I provided freelance services to A Village For Good during my free time. These services included analyzing public health data and resources for nonprofit reporting. I also assisted in analyzing and summarizing census and community data for a New York county's 2023 Community Needs Assessment. 
								<br><br>
								In this portfolio, you'll find projects that illustrate my proficiency in extracting insights from complex datasets. These projects explain my interest in solving real-world challenges through data-driven solutions. I am committed to adding more projects in the future that illustrate my skills in data analytics and my ability to communicate with diverse groups and stakeholders. 
								<br><br>
								I am thrilled to share my journey with you and demonstrate how my unique blend of expertise in public health and data analytics can contribute to your organization's success. With a deep-rooted passion for improving health outcomes and a knack for translating data into actionable insights, I can empower your team to make informed decisions that drive positive change.
